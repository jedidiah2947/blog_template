    <h1>B.TECH DTDP</h1>
    <h1>(DIGITAL TECHNIQUES FOR DESIGN AND PLANNING):</h1>

    <p> The BTech DTDP (Digital Techniques for Design and Planning) course typically focuses on the application of technology and design principles in various fields. This program is geared toward students interested in integrating design with technology to solve complex problems, often in areas like product development, industrial design, or technological innovation.</p>
    <p>
        Here’s a broad outline of what you might expect in such a course:
    </p>
    <h3>
        Core Areas:
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> <h4>Design Principles: </h4> Understanding the fundamental principles of design, including aesthetics, functionality, and user experience.
        </li>
        <li> <h4>Technology Integration:  </h4>Learning how to incorporate various technologies into design processes, such as CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software and other digital tools.</li>
        <li> <h4>Product Development: </h4> Gaining skills in designing and developing products from concept to finished product, including prototyping and testing.</li>
        <li> <h4>GIS (Geographic information system): </h4>A geographic information system (GIS) is a computer system for capturing, storing, checking, and displaying data related to positions on Earth's surface. GIS can show many different kinds of data on one map, such as streets, buildings, and vegetation.</li>
        <li> <h4>IT (information technology):  </h4>Exploring how to manage and drive innovation within organizations, including project management and team collaboration.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        Practical Skills:
    </h3>

      <ul>
        <li> <h4>Technical Drawing and CAD:  </h4> Mastering technical drawing techniques and computer-aided design tools.
        </li>
        <li> <h4>Prototyping and Testing </h4>Learning how to create and test prototypes to refine designs.</li>
        <li> <h4>Project Management: </h4> Developing skills in managing projects, including timelines, resources, and team dynamics.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>
        Career Prospects:
    </h3>
    <p>Graduates of a BTech DTDP course might pursue careers in fields such as:</p>
